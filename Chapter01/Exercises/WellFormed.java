Chapter 01 - Exercise 3
Write a complete Java program called WellFormed that prints the following output:
A wellâ€“formed Java program has
a main method with { and }
braces.

A System.out.println statement
has ( and ) and usually a
String that starts and ends
with a " character.
(But we type \" instead!)
*/
public class WellFormed {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("A well-formed Java program has a main method with { and } braces.");
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("A System.out.println statement has ( and ) and usually a String that starts and ends with a \" character. (But we type \\\" instead!)");
  }
