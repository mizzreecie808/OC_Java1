Chapter 01 - Exercise 3
Write a complete Java program called WellFormed that prints the following output:
A well–formed Java program has
a main method with { and }
braces.

A System.out.println statement
has ( and ) and usually a
String that starts and ends
with a " character.
(But we type \" instead!)
