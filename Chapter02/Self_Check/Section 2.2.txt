Chapter 2 - Self-Check Problems

Section 2.2: Variables

 6. Which of the following choices is the correct syntax for declaring a real number variable named 
    grade and initializing its value to 4.0?

    a) int grade: 4.0;
    b) grade = double 4.0;
    c) double grade = 4.0; <-- answer
    d) grade = 4;
    e) 4.0 = grade;

 7. Imagine you are writing a personal fitness program that stores the user’s age, gender, height (in feet 
    or meters), and weight (to the nearest pound or kilogram). Declare variables with the appropriate names 
    and types to hold this information.
    int age;
    String gender;
    double height;
    double weight;

 8. Imagine you are writing a program that stores a student’s year (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior), 
    the number of courses the student is taking, and his or her GPA on a 4.0 scale. Declare variables with 
    the appropriate names and types to hold this information.
    String year;
    int numberOfCourses;
    double gpa;

 9. Suppose you have an int variable called number. 
    What Java expression produces the last digit of the number (the 1s place)?
    number % 10 = last digit

10. The following program contains 7 mistakes! What are they?

 1  public class Oops2 {
 2      public static void main(String[] args) {
 3          int x;
 4          System.out.println("x is" x);
 5
 6          int x = 15.2;  // set x to 15.2
 7          System.out.println("x is now + x");
 8
 9          int y;  // set y to 1 more than x
10          y = int x + 1;
11          System.out.println("x and y are " + x + and + y);
12      }
13  }

1. Line 4:  There should be a "+" between the string and x
2. Line 4:  Variable x not assigned a value yet
3. Line 6:  Redeclaring x variable
4. Line 6:  Assigning a double to an int, missing (double) casting
5. Line 7:  The 2nd x should be outside the quotes with a "+" in between the string and the variable
6. Line 10: The "int" should be removed
7. Line 11: The word and should be surrounded by "" (quotes)

11. Suppose you have an int variable called number. 
    What Java expression produces the second-to-last digit of the number (the 10s place)? 
    number / 10 % 10	
    What expression produces the third-to-last digit of the number (the 100s place)?
    number / 100 % 10

12. What is the value of variable x after the following code executes?

    int x = 3;
    x = x + 2; // x = 5
    x = x + x; // x = 10

    a) 3
    b) 5
    c) 7
    d) 10 <-- answer
    e) 12

13. What are the values of a, b, and c after the following statements?

    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    int c = b;	// c = 10

    a = a + 1;	// a = 6
    b = b - 1;	// b = 9
    c = c + a;	// c = 16

14. What are the values of first and second at the end of the following code? 
    How would you describe the net effect of the code statements in this exercise?

    int first = 8;
    int second = 19;

    first = first + second;	// 27
    second = first − second;	// 8
    first = first − second;	// 19

15. Rewrite the code from the previous exercise to be shorter, by declaring the variables together and by using 
    the special assignment operators (e.g., +=, −=, *=, and /=) as appropriate.

16. What are the values of i, j, and k after the following statements?

    int i = 2;
    int j = 3;
    int k = 4;
    int x = i + j + k;	// x = 9

    i = x - i - j;	// i = 4
    j = x - j - k;	// j = 2
    k = x - i - k;	// k = 1

17. What is the output from the following code?

    int max;
    int min = 10;
    max = 17 − 4 / 10;	// max = 17
    max = max + 6;	// max = 23
    min = max − min;	// min = 13

    System.out.println(max * 2);	// 46
    System.out.println(max + min);	// 36
    System.out.println(max);		// 23
    System.out.println(min);		// 13

18. Suppose you have a real number variable x. 
    Write a Java expression that computes the following value while using the * operator only four times:

    y = 12.x^4 - 9.1x^3 + 19.3x^2 - 4.6x + 34.2

19. The following program redundantly repeats the same expressions many times. 
    Modify the program to remove all redundant expressions using variables of appropriate types.

 1   public class ComputePay {
 2       public static void main(String[] args) {
 3           // Calculate pay at work based on hours worked each day
 4           System.out.println("My total hours worked:");
 5           System.out.println(4 + 5 + 8 + 4);
 6
 7           System.out.println("My hourly salary:");
 8           System.out.println("$8.75");
 9
10           System.out.println("My total pay:");
11           System.out.println((4 + 5 + 8 + 4) * 8.75);
12
13           System.out.println("My taxes owed:");  // 20% tax
14           System.out.println((4 + 5 + 8 + 4) * 8.75 * 0.20);
15          }
16      }

 1   public class ComputePay {
 2       public static void main(String[] args) {
 3           // Calculate pay at work based on hours worked each day
 4	     int totalHours = 4 + 5 + 8 + 4;
 5	     double salary = 8.75;
 6	     double totalPay = totalHours * salary;
 7	     double taxRate = 0.20;
 8	     double taxedPay = totalPay * taxRate;
 9
10           System.out.println("My total hours worked:\n" + totalHours);
11           System.out.println("My hourly salary:\n" + "$" + salary);
12	     System.out.println("My total pay:\n" + totalPay);
13	     System.out.println("My taxes owed:\n + taxedPay");
14          }
15      }

20. The following program redundantly repeats the same expressions many times. 
    Modify the program to remove all redundant expressions using variables of appropriate types.

// This program computes the total amount owed for a meal,
// assuming 8% tax and a 15% tip.
public class Receipt {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Subtotal:");
        System.out.println(38 + 40 + 30);
        System.out.println("Tax:");
        System.out.println((38 + 40 + 30) * .08);
        System.out.println("Tip:");
        System.out.println((38 + 40 + 30) * .15);
        System.out.println("Total:");
        System.out.println(38 + 40 + 30 +
                           (38 + 40 + 30) * .08 +
                           (38 + 40 + 30) * .15);
    }
}

public class Receipt {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	int subTotal = 38 + 40 + 30;
        System.out.println("Subtotal:");
        System.out.println(subTotal);

	double tax = subTotal * .08;
        System.out.println("Tax:");
        System.out.println(tax);

	double tip = subTotal * .15;
        System.out.println("Tax:");
        System.out.println(tax);

	double total = subTotal + tax + tip;
        System.out.println("Total:");
        System.out.println(total);
    }
}
