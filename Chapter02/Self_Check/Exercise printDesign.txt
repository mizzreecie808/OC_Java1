Step 1: 
Analyze Output for SIZE = 5

line	−L	Digit 	Digit	−R	Width
                Value	Count
1	5	1	1	5	11
2	4	3	3	4	11
3	3	5	5	3	11
4	2	7	7	2	11
5	1	9	9	1	11

Expressions for SIZE = 5

Char		Sequence		Difference	Expression (in terms of line)
−		5, 4, 3, 2, 1		-1		6 - line
Digit Value	1, 3, 5, 7, 9		+2		2 * line -1
Digit Count	1, 3, 5, 7, 9		+2		2 * line -1
Total Width	11, 11, 11, 11, 11	0 		11

Expressions for SIZE = 5

Character	Expression (in terms of line)
−		Starts at 5, decreases by 1	(6 - line)
Digit Value	Starts at 1, increases by 2	(2 * line - 1)
Digit Count	Starts at 1, increases by 2	(2 * line - 1)
Total Width	Constant (WIDTH)		11

Step 2: Determine Scalability (The SIZE Constant)
The SIZE constant usually determines the height of the output (number of lines) and 
the maximum width or starting width. For this triangular pattern, the SIZE likely 
relates to the width.

Analysis for SIZE = 3 (Hypothetical)
line	−L	Digit 	Digit	−R	Width
                Value	Count
1	3	1	1	3	7
2	2	3	3	2	7
3	1	5	5	1	7

Expressions for SIZE = 3

Character	Expression (in terms of line)
−		Starts at 3, decreases by 1	(4 - line)
Digit Value	Same as before			(2 * line - 1)
Digit Count	Same as before			(2 * line - 1)
Total Width	Constant (WIDTH)		7

Step 3: Find the General Expression with SIZE
We'll use the results for SIZE = 5 and SIZE = 3 to find the 
A * line + B * SIZE + C constants

A. Expression for Digit Value and Digit Count
The expression 
(2 * line - 1)
works for both SIZE = 5 and SIZE = 3
Since the expression is independent of SIZE, the B * SIZE term = 0

Expression for Digit Value and Count = 2 * line - 1
B. Expression for the Hyphen (-) Count
The line coefficient A is constant at -1. 
We need to find the constant term B * SIZE + C

The constant term is what the expression for SIZE must equal when line = 0

Constant = (Value at line = 1) - (A * 1)
SIZE = 5:
           (Value at line = 1) is 5
           Required Constant: 5 - (-1 * 1) = 6

Equation 1: 5B + C = 6

SIZE = 3:
	   (Value at line = 1) is 3
	    Required Constant: 3- (-1 * 1) = 4

Equation 2: 3B + C = 4

Solve for B and C:

(5B + C) - (3B + C) = 6 - 4
		 2B = 2
		  B = 1
Substitute B = 1 into Equation 2:

	   3(1) + C = 4
	      3 + C = 4
		  C = 1
The constant term is (1 * SIZE + 1)
Expression for (-) count (SIZE + 1 - line)

C. Expression for Total Width
The total width is constant for any given SIZE

Width is 11 when SIZE = 5

Width is  7 when SIZE = 3

The relationship is B * SIZE + C
Equation 1:  5B + C = 11

Equation 2:  3B + C = 7

Solve for B and C:

(5B + C) - (3B + C) = 11 - 7
		 2B = 4
		  B = 2

Substitute B = 2 into Equation 2:

	   3(2) + C = 7
	      6 + C = 7
		  C = 1

Expression for Total Width (2 * SIZE + 1)
