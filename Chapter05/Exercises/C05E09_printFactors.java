/*
Write a method called printFactors that accepts an integer as its parameter and uses a
fencepost loop to print the factors of that number, separated by the word "and".
printFactors(24):
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 6 and 8 and 12 and 24
You may assume that the parameterâ€™s value is greater than 0, or you may throw an
exception if it is 0 or negative.
