/*
Write a method called printAverage that uses a sentinel loop to repeatedly prompt the
user for numbers. Once the user types any number less than zero, the method should
display the average of all nonnegative numbers typed. Display the average as a double.
Here is a sample dialogue with the user:
Type a number: 7
Type a number: 4
Type a number: 16
Type a number: â€“4
Average was 9.0
