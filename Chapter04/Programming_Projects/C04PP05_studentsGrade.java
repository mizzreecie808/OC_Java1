/*
Write a program that computes a studentâ€™s grade in a course. The course grade has
three components: homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a final exam. The
program should prompt the user for all information necessary to compute the grade,
such as the number of homework assignments, the points earned and points possible for
each assignment, the midterm and final exam scores, and whether each exam was curved
(and, if so, by how much).

Consider writing a variation of this program that reports what final exam score the
student needs to get a certain course grade.
