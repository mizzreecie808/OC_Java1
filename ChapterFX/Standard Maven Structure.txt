1. The Standard Maven Structure:
   The core part of the setup is:
   - src /     contains all your source code src/main/java/JavaFXGUI.java
   - target /  folder where Maven puts compiled code, JARs and other artifacts
     this folder is automatically created by Maven
   - pom.xml / defines the project, its dependencies (like JavaFX modules),
     and how to build it (using plugins like javafx:run)
   All within a project folder
